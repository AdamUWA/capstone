# MDS Capstone Course Report

# Introduction

The [coroner project](https://github.com/AdamUWA/coroner) is result of the work of myself and my team members through working with Dr. Matt Albrecht [WACRSR](https://www.uwa.edu.au/projects/centre-for-road-safety-research/wacrsr-site-link) to design, implement, and evaluate a data extraction application for use on coroners reports. The purpose of this report is to document my personal contribution to the the project. I will explain the tasks in the project in addition to the following:

## Methods (as shown in Github) & Results

- Problem Formulation: How did you make an informed decision for choosing the approach(es)/method(s)? Through past learning and experience, literature search, working with teams, seeking help or self directed learning? What general methodology you have learned in this project on approaching a new field with challenging problems?
 
- Problem Solving: For each of your chosen methods, explain the approach (with references), present the experiemental results, and discuss pros and cons. What's your take-away from such exercises? Which unit(s) in your MDS program has helped with the method selection, implementation and evaluation? What topics are missing or you wish you have studied. 

- Ethical, Responsible AI and Broader Social Impact: What potential social issues/impact that your models may have if wrong predictions or results are given? How would you mitgate this? Is there a non-data science or non-AI solution to this? 

## Personal Reflection

What were the technical and non-technical challenges and how did you overcome them; and what would you do differently, given your new experience and limits on time.
