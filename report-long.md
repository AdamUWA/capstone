# Introduction

The [coroner project](https://github.com/AdamUWA/coroner) is result of the work of myself and my team members through working with Dr. Matt Albrecht [WACRSR](https://www.uwa.edu.au/projects/centre-for-road-safety-research/wacrsr-site-link) to design, implement, and evaluate a data extraction application for use on coroners reports. The purpose of this report is to document my personal contribution to the the project.

## Tasks 

Explanation of your tasks in the project.

## Methods (as shown in Github) & Results

- **Problem Formulation**: How did you make an informed decision for choosing the approach(es)/method(s)? Through past learning and experience, literature search, working with teams, seeking help or self directed learning? What general methodology you have learned in this project on approaching a new field with challenging problems?
 
- **Problem Solving**: For each of your chosen methods, explain the approach (with references), present the experiemental results, and discuss pros and cons. What's your take-away from such exercises? Which unit(s) in your MDS program has helped with the method selection, implementation and evaluation? What topics are missing or you wish you have studied. 

- **Ethical, Responsible AI and Broader Social Impact**: What potential social issues/impact that your models may have if wrong predictions or results are given? How would you mitgate this? Is there a non-data science or non-AI solution to this? 

## Personal Reflection

What were the technical and non-technical challenges and how did you overcome them; and what would you do differently, given your new experience and limits on time.



## Tasks

## Methods & Results

### Problem Formulation

My decision making framework for method selection can be divided into two aspects. Firstly, an intuition based methodology derived from domain knowledge and past experience. Secondly, a purely analytical methodology utilising standard academic methods of literature review and research. For the intuitive approach I relied on knowledge developed from previous coursework (eg., Natural Language Processing; Deep Learning; etc) and personal interest (eg., databases; RAG/LLM systems; etc). This intuition enabled me to recognise important aspects of the project requirements; the relevant/appropriate approaches; and the direction of focus for further investigation via the second approach - traditional research.















## NB

- Cannot use a rules based system for info. extraction. Why? Would require determining/enumerating all possible ... Leads to dynamic system (RAG).
