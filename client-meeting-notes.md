# Client Meeting Notes
#### Client: Dr. Matt Albrecht
#### Organisation: [Western Australian Centre for Road Safety Research (WACRSR)](https://www.uwa.edu.au/projects/centre-for-road-safety-research/wacrsr-site-link)

Acting as the primary client liaison these are my notes of the meetings with our client Dr. Matt Albrecht.


## Meeting 1
#### Tuesday, 5 August 2025
##### Attendees: Adam Holt; Divya Seetharama; Rahul Sharma; Tahsin Rahman; Zhenye Zhou

- First meeting with client.
- Group introductions, i.e., experience and interests.
- Dr. Albrecht outlines the project and scope.
- I propose a very rudimentary and basic idea/framework to get started (i.e., simple data processing pipeline).

## Meeting 2
#### Wednesday, 20 August 2025
##### Attendees: Adam Holt; Divya Seetharama; Tahsin Rahman; Zhenye Zhou

- Informed by my research summary I present the group proposal to Dr. Albrecht.
- I outline the basic structure and architecture of the proposed data application:
  - Preporocessor
  - Vector Database
  - RAG/LLM
- Dr. Albrecht accepts the basic idea and gives the go-ahead to begin work.

## Meeting 3
#### Thursday, 11 September 2025
##### Attendees: Adam Holt; Divya Seetharama; Rahul Sharma

- I show Dr. Albrecht a very basic and rudimentary working example of the application (i.e., a pilot demo) which I had developed over the study break.
- Dr. Albrecht asks many good questions which help inform the direction and next steps for continuing development.
- After the meeting with Dr. Albrecht I explain in detail to the team how the system functions.

## Meeting 4
#### Thursday, 25 September 2025
##### Attendees: Adam Holt

- At this point I have built out the demo/pilot system into a semi-complete working application and I present the main functionality.
- Dr. Albrecht is again pleased with the demonstration but explains that he would appreciate some changes/extra functionality, i.e., the preference to use the system programmatically instead of only interactively.
- I agree with Dr. Albrechts points and begin work to extend the system to include non-interactive use.
- Finally, I explain how evaluation of the system is proposed to be done and that we'd develop sets of QA pairs for the documents which Dr. Albrecht agrees is satisfactory for evaluation.

## Meeting 5
#### Wednesday, 8 October 2025
##### Attendees: Adam Holt

- I demonstrate to Dr. Albrecht the extension modules that I'd developed to integrate the extended functionality (from last meeting).
- Dr. Albrecht is pleased with the result and expresses that it is "exactly what he wanted", which I am very happy about.
- I also explain to Dr. Albrecht the evaluations in progress on the QA sets using the BERTScore semantic similarity metric.
- We wrap the meeting with the understanding that the system is functioning well and that Dr. Albrecht's expectations have been met.
- Finally, I suggest another meeting once the course has wrapped up where I will give a thorough run down of the application in case anything is unclear or there are any configuration details needing further explanation.
